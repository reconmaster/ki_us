Objective: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource][resources]]
* Introduction
The potential benefit of using open-source technology for the
improvement of governance has been with this country since its
inception. The collaborative nature of our foundational documents
themselves provided the framework that allowed the development of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License][GNU]],
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux][Linux]], and eventually [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][Git]].
* Background
The use of open-source technologies have yielded some exceptional
operating platforms for computer hardware (ex. [[https://www.archlinux.org/][archlinux]]). As such, I
hypothesize utilizing similar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure][infrastructure]] could yield useful
results for the code running on our [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue][civil]] hardware.

Let's not forget that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping][bootstrap]] is part of the OS too.
** Examples
The use of git in governance has already been anticipated.

 Some good insight.

 An effort by the NY Senate to improves legislative transparency.

 A good description of how version control can help improve governance.

Only the educated are free.

This is a more foundational level of the source code.
** TODO K-12
By introducing children to the workings of open-source technology and
the civil platform, the future [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation][generation]] will become familiar with
the computational tools needed to participate in a knowledge-based
economy as well as the tools need to participate in civil discourse.

** TODO [[file:university.org][University]]
These institutions have collected a lot of rarefied thinking
pertaining to all levels of this proposition. For this software to
show its true Value, a lot of collaboration would be in order.

As these institutions themselves are modules running on this platform,
the may see the benefit in actively developing the code base on which
they function.
* TODO [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government][Government]]
In order to run this software, an interface with all branches of
government must be established.

 It will be necessary to convince legislators that it is in the best
 interest of their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district][constituency]] to adopt good coding practices.
 Utilizing the version control features alone would improve
 transparency and accountability in the writing of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law][laws]].

 As this branch is tasked with deciding the constitutionality of the
 laws, they would be in charge of deciding the constitutionality of
 each version release.
